# cdc
Python code for the CDC Pi Weather Station Project

Sheffield Pi Station created a brillaint Pythond Script to publish sensor data from the BMP180 to the MET office and Plot.ly

I'm now trying to edit the code to work with the 1wire DS18B20 sensor - with no luck! 

There's potentially an issue with the DS18B20 and the number of decimial places it uses, which isn't compatible with the conversion being used by the original script.
